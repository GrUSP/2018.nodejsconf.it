  title: "Node.js: The Road to Workers"
  extract: >
    Workers, and threading support in general, have been one of the most frequently requested features for Node.js over
    the last years. Finally, the finishing line is in sight and weâ€™re pretty excited to have experimental support
    available! This talk will tell you everything around the API, features, use cases & alternatives, our roadmap,
    and the technical and social challenges that we had to overcome to make it happen, as well as an overview over
    exciting changes in Node.js 10 & 11!

  title: Node.js as a feature-flipping supervisor through Git
  extract: >
    Let's imagine you run a complex service or app, and you have to manage a backend solution that grows fast.
    You have to find a way to handle the releases cycle. It means taking care of restarting services,
    migrating databases, expiring caches, as well as notifying client's apps for the update.
    Now, add a new layer of complexity: to quickly try-and-fail, you also use a feature-flipping architecture that
    allows you to run tests on various client segments. Even for a limited amount of time.
    And, because your team is great, you deliver several times a day.
    To address all those needs, Node.js is a great candidate. Properly hooked behind a Git repository that will
    allow you to push your codebase and configs, we can conceive a modular system to manage your deployment process.
    Based on Streams and Functional Programming, we will present a global solution capable to deliver your codebase
    and reprocess its configuration on-the-fly. With a simple git push.
    Let's see what a modern, robust, and distributed deployment platform should look like.
